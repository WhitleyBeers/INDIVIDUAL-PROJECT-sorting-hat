# Whitley's Sorting Hat  [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/22c4b077-112d-45cb-b920-773c5069f225/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wbeers-sorting-hat/deploys)

I created an app that sorts people into a random Hogwarts house.  Click the "Sort Me" button, enter your name, and let the Sorting Hat do the rest!  You will find your name and house under the "Current Students" heading.  You can also expel students to Voldemort's Army.

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a group that needs to split themselves into random teams.
- This could be useful for events like trivia, scavenger hunts, or any other game that requires different teams.
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to "sort" themselves into random teams - saving the hassle of either one person determining teams or people teaming up with the same groups over and over, maybe not allowing themselves to get to know others as well.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new student is submitted using the form, the student is randomly sorted into a house and appears on a new card in the "Current Students" column.
- The color of the students' cards vary depending on which house they were sorted into.
- Cards are ordered alphabetically by their Hogwarts House.
- When a current student is expelled, their card disappears from the "Current Student" column and shows under the "Voldemort's Army" column.  Their card reflects that they have decided to join the Death Eaters.
